# Portal Properties Portlet

This is a simple portlet that allows editing Liferay's various portal properties from the portal itself. Once installed, the portlet will show up in the Control Panel, under "Configuration". Obviously, the user under which the Liferay process runs needs to have write access to the relevant directories. The portlet will check for these permissions and will only show Save/Create buttons if the files can indeed be written.
